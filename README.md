RAF Operating System (RAF_OS) - Multiprocessing support

RAF_OS is a simple, educational, DOS-like operating system made by students at College of Computer Science, Union University, Belgrade. It was written in NASM (the netwide assembler). In this iteration, RAF_OS has been enhanced by the addition of multiprocessing mechanisms which required a whole different set of memory management algorithms. It is now possible to run almost 30 processes at the same time.
